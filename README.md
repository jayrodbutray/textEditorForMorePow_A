# textEditorForMorePow_A

## Progressive Web Application code was given in order to add to a text editor app for on and offline functionality. We do this in case one of the data techniques isn't supported by the browser. Fetching and storing data methods are used here for storage.

### I did a lot of online searching on this application. It wasn't a week that brain really understood how PWA works. Class videos and assignments helped with getting code entered into the right fields. I received help from my instructor, Robbert, and a TA, Elena.
